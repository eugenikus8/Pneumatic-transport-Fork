Version 1.1.7
Date: 2023-10-27
  Fixes:
    - fixed dfs search infinite loop (no longer crashing no start due to mod incompatibilities)
    - rocket silo added to liquify list
    - repair packs added to liquify list
    - se: rocket science pack added to liquify list (as exception - cant find root cause of failure)
	- updated hidden inserter flags (should no longer show up in upgrade screen)
  Changes:
    - set fluid storage in fluidizer/solidifier to 150 (15 items at default settings)
	- added settings to vary recipe & fluid quantities (10/recipe & 10 fluid per item as defaults)
    - added setting to vary hidden inserter stack size (10 default) to be able to edit buffer sizing (global)
    - added 'heavy item' option (1/recipe & 100 fluid per item), currently includes only U235 & rocket silo, but you can add your own (comma delimiter)
  Broken:
    - Still cant figure out why K2SE is causing a bunch of issues (recipes hidden, items not fluidized, etc.) - for now K2SE isnt supported unless either I or someone else figures out whats going on.
  TODO:
    - changing settings (recipe/fluid quantities, hidden inserter stack size) has no impact on already placed entities. Need to add a settings-changed-check & update. For now its recommended to set the settings up and not change them during gameplay

  Changes:
    - Limited the input of fluidizers to 2x recipe (so 20 max instead of original 100)

  Breaking changes:
    - Input limits may mean that updating an existing save will cause item loss (100->20) in full fluidizers
