pneumatic-intake=Retrieves items from attached building and liquifies them into the pipe system.
pneumatic-outtake=Solidifies the items from the pipe system and transfers them to attached building.
pneumatic-intake-filtered=Retrieves filtered items from attached building and liquifies them into the pipe system.
pneumatic-outtake-filtered=Solidifies filtered items from the pipe system and moves them to attached building.

pneumatic-no-belts=Remove belts
pneumatic-no-wagons=Remove item wagons
pneumatic-no-inserters=Remove inserters

pneumatic-recipe-multiplier=Recipe multiplier
pneumatic-fluid-per-item=Fluid per item
pneumatic-inserter-stack-size=Item transfer stack size
pneumatic-heavy-items=Heavy items
pneumatic-bottleneck-ignore=Ignore bottleneck indicator
pneumatic-crafting-speed=Crafting speed

[mod-setting-description]
pneumatic-no-belts=Remove belt entities to force a liquid-only gameplay.
pneumatic-no-wagons=Remove item wagons to force usage of fluid wagons only.
pneumatic-no-inserters=Remove inserter entities to disallow direct-insertion\nTrue Pneumatic-Only!\nPlease ensure you dont have loader/mini-loader mods enabled!
pneumatic-thin-pipes=Adds low throughput pipes (regular-iron pipes only!) with 1/10th capacity to help decrease buffer size (only 1 item/pipe segment instead of 10).
pneumatic-recipe-multiplier=Number of items (capped at item stack size/5) that are converted at once. For example, if the stack size is 50, then the conversion will not occur until 10 items have accumulated.\nWARNING: make sure #items x fluid/item is below 150!
pneumatic-fluid-per-item=Amount of fluid 1 item creates (10=~100items/sec throughput)\nHigh values reduce the throughput, but also the buffer in the pipes.\nWARNING: make sure #items x fluid/item is below 100!
pneumatic-inserter-stack-size=Amount of items transferred by the hidden inserters at a time (30x this per second is the max throughput), higher = higher buffer.
pneumatic-heavy-items=List (comma separated, lua names) of "heavy" items (recipe size of 1, fluid quantity of 100 - item throughput of ~10/sec, buffer of 1/pipe).
pneumatic-bottleneck-ignore=Do not show Bottleneck indicator icons.
pneumatic-crafting-speed=Increases crafting speed. Affects pollution.

[mod-name]
pneumatic-transport=Pneumatic Transport Fork

[mod-description]
pneumatic-transport=Removes all belts and adds pneumatic in/out stations (with built in inserters) that convert any/all items into fluid-like states for transport through pipes.\nAlternative lore: LIQUIFY EVERYTHING!!!!
