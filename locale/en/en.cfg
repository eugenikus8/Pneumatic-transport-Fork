[entity-description]
pneumatic-end-point-intake=Retrieves items from attached building and liquifies them into the pipe system.
pneumatic-end-point-intake-filtered=Retrieves filtered items from attached building and liquifies them into the pipe system.
pneumatic-end-point-outtake=Solidifies the items from the pipe system and transfers them to attached building.

[entity-name]
pneumatic-end-point-intake=Item liquifier
pneumatic-end-point-intake-filtered=Filtered item liquifier
pneumatic-end-point-outtake=Item solidifier

[fluid-name]
pneumatic-fluid=Fluidized __1__

[mod-setting-name]
pneumatic-no-belts=Remove belts
pneumatic-no-wagons=Remove item wagons
pneumatic-no-inserters=Remove inserters
pneumatic-thin-pipes=Add small pipes
pneumatic-recipe-multiplier=Recipe multiplier
pneumatic-fluid-per-item=Fluid per item
pneumatic-inserter-stack-size=Item transfer stack size
pneumatic-heavy-items=Heavy items
pneumatic-bottleneck-ignore=Ignore bottleneck indicator

[mod-setting-description]
pneumatic-no-belts=Remove belt entities to force a liquid-only gameplay.
pneumatic-no-wagons=Remove item wagons to force usage of fluid wagons only.
pneumatic-no-inserters=Remove inserter entities to disallow direct-insertion\nTrue Pneumatic-Only!\nPlease ensure you dont have loader/mini-loader mods enabled!
pneumatic-thin-pipes=Adds low throughput pipes (regular-iron pipes only!) with 1/10th capacity to help decrease buffer size (only 1 item/pipe segment instead of 10)
pneumatic-recipe-multiplier=Number of items (capped at item stack size/5) that are converted at once.\nWARNING: make sure #items x fluid/item is below 150!
pneumatic-fluid-per-item=Amount of fluid 1 item creates (10=~100items/sec throughput)\nHigher values gives lower throughput but also less buffer in pipes\nWARNING: make sure #items x fluid/item is below 100!
pneumatic-inserter-stack-size=Amount of items transferred by the hidden inserters at a time (30x this per second is the max throughput), higher = higher buffer.
pneumatic-heavy-items=List (comma separated, lua names) of 'heavy' items (recipe size of 1, fluid quantity of 100 - item throughput of ~`10/sec, buffer of 1/pipe)
pneumatic-bottleneck-ignore=Do not show Bottleneck indicator icons

[mod-name]
pneumatic-transport=Pneumatic Transport

[mod-description]
pneumatic-transport=Removes all belts and adds pneumatic in/out stations (with built in inserters) that convert any/all items into fluid-like states for transport through pipes.\nAlternative lore: LIQUIFY EVERYTHING!!!!
